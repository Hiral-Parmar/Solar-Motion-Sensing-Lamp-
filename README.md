# Solar-Motion-Sensing-Lamp-
A smart solar-powered outdoor light using Arduino. Detects motion with a PIR sensor and lights up automatically—bright at first, then dims, and turns off to save power. Runs on a LiFePO4 battery charged by a 20W solar panel. Ideal for gardens, gates, or paths. Simple, efficient, and eco-friendly.

##  Built With
- Arduino Nano
- PIR Motion Sensor
- 12.8V 6Ah LiFePO₄ Battery
- 20W Solar Panel
- PWM Charge Controller
- MOSFET for LED switching
-  Waterproof Enclosure (IP55)

##  How It Works
- Motion detected ➜ LED ON (full brightness) for 5 sec
- Then ➜ LED DIM for next 10 sec
- After 15 sec ➜ LED OFF to save power
- Solar panel charges battery during daytime

## Features
- Motion-triggered smart lighting
- Solar powered and battery operated
- Water and dust resistant (IP55)
- Tested for real outdoor conditions
- Energy-efficient & cost-effective

##  Future Upgrades
- Add Bluetooth/IoT control
- Switch to MPPT controller
- Use PETG enclosure for better UV resistance
