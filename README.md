# Solar-Motion-Sensing-Lamp-
A smart solar-powered outdoor light using Arduino. Detects motion with a PIR sensor and lights up automaticallyâ€”bright at first, then dims, and turns off to save power. Runs on a LiFePO4 battery charged by a 20W solar panel. Ideal for gardens, gates, or paths. Simple, efficient, and eco-friendly.
